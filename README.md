# Roadside Help Application

This is a web application that was made for the Application Development Bachelor class at [USN - Universitetet i Sørøst-Norge](https://www.usn.no/english/). It was made with ASP.NET Core 2.2 with a MVC design pattern.

Google Maps API is used to display a nice map to find mechanics. All the registerted mechanics database will be shown as pins on the map. Click on a pin to send a request for an appointment with that mechanic.

## App purpose
This web-application is to provide an easy overview for customers to find & make appointments with mechanics registered on this app. Customers can create a profile, send & view past requests for appointments to choosen mechanic. 
Mechanics can create profile and input their workshop address details. They will also have a request overview for incoming, current and past requests that has been sent to their workshop. Mechanics can accept or deny requests from customers. They can also send feedback messeges to admin.
If a request is denied, accepted or finished, the customer will get an email notification about that.
